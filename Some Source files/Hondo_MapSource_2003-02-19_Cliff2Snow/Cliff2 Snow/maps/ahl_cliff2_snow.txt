 Description             : Ace's Cliff 2 for AQ2, converted for AHL and then
			   converted to a snow version. A rocky area with usable 
			   cliff around it and a rock bridge overhead, and a 
			   waterfall. And a cable car. I altered the geometry for
			   gameflow and to lower polycount a little (100-150)
