Note: This same readme is distributed with all the individual maps, for added ease (mine). Nothing is missing.


Since I've finished making maps for (and playing) HL, I won't be working with this material anymore. So there's no real reason to keep it to myself. It's probably a lot nicer to work with than some decompiled mess. I only ask that if you use this stuff in any way, you give me credit where it's due. And please keep this archive intact.


As for which versions these are..

"Block War AHL", "Cliff2 Snow", and "Endless Rain HC" are the Beta 4 versions. 
"5am 3" and "No Credit" are the Beta 5 versions. I think I change like, one texture between B4 and B5 for NoCredit.
"Endless Rain" I believe never changed any since its initial release. 
"HDHouse V3" is Hondo's Death House. It was originally for a mod that never got started. Then it was for Sci Hunt. Then I removed a bunch of crap and improved the framerate for AHL, which is this version. I think I submitted it to Holy Goat 3 times before I got it right. I think I ended up pissing him off every time I ever submitted anything to the map depot back before I ran it.
"Endless Rain 2" is version 177, the same one I posted. 

The secrets are mostly grouped separately (I got better about doing this as time went on).


My compile options always were:

hlcsg -estimate
hlbsp -estimate
hlvis -estimate
hlrad -estimate -sparse -bounce 8 -extra -verbose 

As you can see, most of that information is useless. 
You'll need -sparse to get past the 65,535 patches limit that I regularly go over by 30,000 or 40,000.

My lights.rad file is included as well. It has the texture info for all of these maps, I believe.



If there are any problems or questions, e-mail me at Hondo@Telefragged.com. Please contact me if I screwed something up  with this, since it's impossible to test everything now.
